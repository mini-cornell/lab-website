# Machine Intellegence in NeuroImaging (MINI)

The MINI lab at [Weill Medical College of Cornell University](https://weill.cornell.edu/) aims to use artificial intelligence to accelerate the pace of neuroimaging research. We focus on developing novel machine-learning-based computational methods to analyze longitudinal and multi-modal neuroimaging, neuropsychological, and clinical data, and using these methods to explain brain-behavior relationships and determine biomedical phenotypes of neurological diseases.
